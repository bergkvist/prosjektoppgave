Todo list

Labels in visualization:
    ☐ https://codepen.io/dxinteractive/pen/reNpOR
    ☐ https://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/Sprite-Text-Labels.html
    ☐ https://threejs.org/examples/css2d_label.html

Visualize casing shoes and drill bit:
    ☐ Draw kjegle
    ☐ Find optimal size of kjegle

Use color for visualizing pressure:
    ☐ Have any kind of control over color/position

@critical:
    ☐ Actually use geometrydef.txt

@high:
    ☐ Make sea bottom only visible from below. Make ground top only visible from above.
    ☐ Consider lowering sea level slighly to prevent flickering
    ✘ end piece is WRONG! Need to add the two final parts of geometrydef manually? @cancelled(19-10-23 00:25)
